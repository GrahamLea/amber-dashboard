# Amber Electric Dashboard

This is my own custom dashboard for energy price foreccasts from electricity retailer [Amber Electric](https://www.amber.com.au/).
The dashboard is designed to be run on in a browser on a tablet on a wall, and to be interpretable from a distance.


## Use

Amber customers can [click here to use the Dashboard](https://grahamlea.github.io/amber-dashboard/)

(You'll need an API key, which you can generate here: https://app.amber.com.au/developers/ )


## Implementation

Amber [provide customers with an API](https://github.com/amberelectric/public-api/discussions) to access to their data.

The app is built as a simple, one-page [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) app.
(See [index.html](index.html))
