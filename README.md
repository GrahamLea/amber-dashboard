# Amber Electric Dashboard

This is my own custom dashboard for displaying energy price foreccasts from electricity retailer [Amber Electric](https://www.amber.com.au/).

The dashboard is intended to be run full time on a tablet, hung on a wall, and so is designed to be easily understood from a distance.


## Use

Amber customers can simply [click here to access the dashboard](https://grahamlea.github.io/amber-dashboard/)

(You'll need an API key, which you can generate here: https://app.amber.com.au/developers/ )


## Implementation

The dashboard uses the [Amber API](https://github.com/amberelectric/public-api/discussions), through which Amber customers gain get access their own data.

The app is built as a simple, one-page [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) app.
